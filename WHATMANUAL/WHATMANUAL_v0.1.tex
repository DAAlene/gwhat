\paragraph{Data is managed in WHAT by project.
That is all parameter, log, input and output files relative to a given project are saved within a common folder called the project folder or the project directory.
All project folders are saved by default within the folder named Projects (see sectionÂ 2.1), but it is possible to save your project in any other location with the Save in Folder field.
This file management system allows you to easily backup and move your projects from one location to the other since all the files relating to a same project are saved at the same place.
