The working rules are formulated from a set of past observations using an adaptive algorithm. A case study is carried out using the data from three precipitation stations in northern Italy. The study evaluates the performance of this approach compared with an artificial neural network and a traditional statistical approach. The results indicate that, within the parameter sub-space where its rules are trained, the fuzzy rule-based model provided solutions with low mean square error between observations and predictions. The problems that have yet to be addressed are overfitting and applicability outside the range of training data.},

The barometric response function (BRF) has proven to be an effective means to characterize this relationship; we show here how it can also be utilized to glean valuable insights into semi-confined aquifer systems. The form of the BRF indicates the degree of aquifer confinement, while a comparison of BRFs between wells sheds light on hydrostratigraphic continuity. A new approach for estimating hydraulic properties of aquitards from BRFs has been developed and verified. The BRF is not an invariant characteristic of a well; in unconfined or semi-confined aquifers, it can change with conditions in the vadose zone. Field data from a long-term research site demonstrate the hydrostratigraphic insights that can be gained from monitoring water levels and barometric pressure. Such insights should be of value for a wide range of practical applications.},

	abstract = {Summary
Accurate estimate of missing daily precipitation data remains a difficult task particularly for large watersheds with coarse rain gauge network. Reliable and representative precipitation time series are essential for any rainfall–runoff model calibration as well as for setting-up any downscaling model for hydrologic impact study of climate change. This study investigates six different types of artificial neural networks namely the multilayer perceptron (MLP) network and its variations (the time-lagged feedforward network (TLFN)), the generalized radial basis function (RBF) network, the recurrent neural network (RNN) and its variations (the time delay recurrent neural network (TDRNN)), and the counterpropagation fuzzy-neural network (CFNN) along with different optimization methods for infilling missing daily total precipitation records and daily extreme temperature series. Daily precipitation and temperature records from 15 weather stations located within the Gatineau watershed in northeastern Canada, are used to evaluate the accuracy of the different models for infilling data gaps of daily precipitation and daily extreme temperatures. The experiment results suggest that the MLP, the TLFN and the CFNN can provide the most accurate estimates of the missing precipitation values. However, overall, the MLP appears the most effective at infilling missing daily precipitation values. Furthermore, the MLP also appears the most suitable for infilling missing daily maximum and minimum temperature values. The CFNN is similar to the MLP at infilling missing daily maximum temperature, however, it is less effective at estimating minimum temperature. The experiment results show that the dynamically driven networks (RNN and TDRNN) are the less suitable for infilling both the daily precipitation and the extreme temperature records, whereas the RBF appears fairly suitable only for estimating maximum and minimum temperature.},

	abstract = {Abstract A method to estimate missing daily maximum and minimum temperatures is presented. Temperature estimates are based on departures from daily temperature normals at the three closest stations with similar observation times. Although applied to Cooperative Observer Network stations in the northeastern United States, the approach can be used with any network of stations possessing an adequate station density and period of record. Generally, 75\% of the estimates for both daily maximum and minimum temperature are within 1.7°C of the observed value. Median absolute differences between estimated and observed minimum temperatures, however, tend to be greater than those associated with maximum temperatures. For minimum temperatures, median absolute differences are approximately 1.0°C, whereas for maximum temperatures these differences are near 0.5°C. The accuracy of the estimates is independent of observation time, geographic location, and observed temperature but is influenced somewhat by station density.},

Prior to analysis of these time series, it is important to remove outliers in a methodical manner. This study provides statistically derived bounds for the uncertainty associated with surface temperature and precipitation measurements and yields a baseline dataset for validation of climate models as well as for a variety of other climatological uses. A two-step procedure using objective analysis was used to identify outliers. The first step was a temporal check that determines if a particular monthly value is consistent with other monthly values for the same station. The second step utilizes six different spatial interpolation techniques to estimate each monthly time series. Each of the methods is ranked according to its respective correlation coefficients with the actual time series, and the technique with the highest correlation coefficient is chosen as the best estimator. For both temperature and precipitation, a multiple regression scheme was found to be the best estimator for the majority of records. Results from the two steps are merged, and a combined set of quality control flags are generated.},

In recent years, artificial intelligence techniques have gained enormous interest of many researchers in estimating of missing values. In the current study, we evaluated 11 artificial intelligence and classical techniques to determine the most suitable model for estimating of climatological data in three different climate conditions of Iran. In this case, 5 years (2001–2005) of observed data at target and neighborhood stations were used to estimate missing data of monthly minimum temperature, maximum temperature, mean air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and precipitation variables. The comparison includes both visual and parametric approaches using such statistic as mean absolute errors, coefficient of efficiency and skill score. In general, it was found that although the artificial intelligence techniques are more complex and time-consuming models in identifying their best structures for optimum estimation, but they outperform the classical methods in estimating missing data in three distinct climate conditions. Moreover, the in-filling done by artificial neural network rivals that by genetic programming and sometimes becomes more satisfactory, especially for precipitation data. The results also indicated that multiple regression analysis method is the suitable method among the classical methods. The results of this research proved the high importance of choosing the best and most precise method in estimating different climatological data in Iran and other arid and semi-arid regions.},

Presented herein is an effort to develop a new spatial daily rainfall model that is specifically intended to fill in gaps in a daily rainfall dataset. The proposed model is different from a convectional daily rainfall generation scheme in that it takes advantage of concurrent measurements at the nearby sites to increase the accuracy of estimation. The model is based on a two-step approach to handle the occurrence and the amount of daily rainfalls separately. This study tested four neural network classifiers for a rainfall occurrence processor, and two regression techniques for a rainfall amount processor. The test results revealed that a probabilistic neural network approach is preferred for determining the occurrence of daily rainfalls, and a stepwise regression with a log-transformation is recommended for estimating daily rainfall amounts.},
