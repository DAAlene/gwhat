\chapter*{Foreword}


WHAT started originally as a little piece of code to fill missing data in .

This document is divided in three parts: User Manuel, Theoretical Basis and Technical Documentation.

The part User Manual contains all the information relative to the use of the software.

Theoretical Basis contains literature review, mathematics and theoretical development and theoretical concepts on which the tools included in WHAT are based on.

Technical Documendation contains everything that is programming related. The entire code is presented in flowchart and the structure and organization of the source files.
