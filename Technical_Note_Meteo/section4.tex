However, weighing and regression-based techniques, including the MLR method, all tend to overestimate the number of rainy days, while heavy precipitation events are systematically underestimated. Therefore, the rainfall probability distribution is usually not preserved with these techniques). However, Simolo et al. (2010) have proposed a two-step procedure to modify the MLR method to address these issues.

An alternative approach would have been to calculate the correlation coefficient with a subset of data from the target series centered around the missing value, as it was done in Simolo et al. (2010) for instance. This approach allows for a better representation of the seasonal variations in the relationships between the stations. The downsides include a more complex algorithm to implement and a reduction of the method robustness and efficiency.
