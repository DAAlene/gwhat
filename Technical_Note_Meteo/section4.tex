\subsection{Materials and Method}

\subsubsection{Study Area}

The algorithm was tested using data from 32 land-based Canadian weather stations in and around the Monteregie Est region, located in southern Quebec, Canada. This region covers a total area of \SI{9032}{km^2}, from the St. Lawrence River at its northern limit to the border of the United States (states of New York and Vermont) at its southern limit (see \cref{fig:montEst_loc}). It is characterized by strongly variable topography and land cover conditions. The climate of this region is characterized by significant seasonal differences in temperature, resulting in warm summers and cold winters. Total precipitation, as rain or snow, are distributed rather evenly throughout the year. Precipitation as rain also occurs frequently in the winter season due to mild spells.

\subsubsection{Weather Stations}

A total of 32 weather stations were selected from the Canadian Daily Climate Database (CDCD) based on the availability and continuity of the measured weather data between 1980 and 2014. The data were downloaded and formatted to the format described in \cref{subsec:input} using the software WHAT \citep{gosselin_user_2015}. WHAT provides a graphical interface to the online CDCD that allows to search for stations interactively using location coordinates, download the available data for the selected weather stations, and automatically organize the data in a format that is compatible with the gap-filling algorithm presented in this paper.

\Cref{tab:selectedStations} presents the list of the stations used in this study with their corresponding climate~ID, location coordinates (latitude and longitude), altitude, time periods for which data were available, yearly averages and percentage of days with missing data. Most of the information presented in \cref{tab:selectedStations} are generated automatically when loading data into the gap-filling routine and saved in a file named `weather\_datasets\_summary.log' within the previously defined output folder. The geographical disposition of the weather stations is also presented in the map of \cref{fig:Thiessen_meteo}.

\subfile{table_list_of_stations}

Total annual precipitation for all of these stations, The mean annual total precipitation is \SI{1100}{mm/y}. The highest total precipitation are observed at the Brome station ($\sim$\SI{1280}{mm/y}), while the lowest at the Sorel station ($\sim$\SI{960}{mm/year}). Mean annual air temperature in the study area is \SI{5.9}{\celsius}, ranging from \SIrange{4.3}{6.7}{\celsius} while average monthly temperatures fluctuate between \SIrange{-12}{21}{\celsius}. The minimum monthly temperatures are observed in January \SIrange{-17.1}{-13.6}{\celsius}) while the maximum monthly temperatures are observed in July (\SIrange{24}{26.7}{\celsius}).
The highest temperatures are observed at the Philipsburg et Saint-Bernard stations and the lowest at Bonsecours station.

\subsubsection{Cross-Validation}

In order to validate the procedure for the Monteregie Est region, the cross-validation procedure described in \cref{subsec:crossval} was applied to the 19 weather stations that are located within the study area (stations that are shown in red in \cref{tab:selectedStations}). Data from the stations bordering the limits of the study area, but outside of it, were used to improve the spatial distribution of the weather data. 

The method was tested with the parameter values that are set by default in the algorithm, as shown in \cref{tab:method_parameter} in \ref{appendix}. That is, the maximum number of neighboring stations was set to 4, the horizontal and vertical distance thresholds were kept at \SI{100}{km} and \SI{350}{km} values respectively. However, the OLS method was chosen for the regression instead of the LAD to save in computation time.

\subsection{Results}

\Cref{tab:crossval_restuls} presents the results of the cross-validation procedure for the accuracy of the method. The Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE), the Mean-Absolute Error (MAE), the Mean Error (ME) and the correlation coefficient (r), calculated as described in \cref{subsec:crossval}, are given for each of the 19 weather stations, and each of the four weather variables tested (T\textsubscript{max}, T\textsubscript{min}, T\textsubscript{mean}, and P\textsubscript{tot}). The mean, max, and min value for each estimator is also given at the bottom of the table.


\subsubsection{Air Temperature}

The method gives consistent results for all the weather stations for each of the three temperature-related weather variables.

%The quality of the estimates is strongly affected by seasonality. Stations at higher elevations are difficult to estimate accurately, in large part because of the topographical diversity of the surrounding stations leading to degradation of spatial coherence among stations.

%The tendency for all of the methods to have a negative bias is indicative of the nature of precipitation distributions to be positively skewed (interpolated values will tend to cluster about the median error rather than the mean).

%According to \cite{xia_forest_1999}, the two most important factors in climatology are the inter-correlations in the station network, and the seasonal variations in the relations between the stations.

\subsection{Discussion}

However, weighing and regression-based techniques, including the MLR method, all tend to overestimate the number of rainy days, while heavy precipitation events are systematically underestimated. Therefore, the rainfall probability distribution is usually not preserved with these techniques). However, Simolo et al. (2010) have proposed a two-step procedure to modify the MLR method to address these issues.

An alternative approach would have been to calculate the correlation coefficient with a subset of data from the target series centered around the missing value, as it was done in Simolo et al. (2010) for instance. This approach allows for a better representation of the seasonal variations in the relationships between the stations. The downsides include a more complex algorithm to implement and a reduction of the method robustness and efficiency.
