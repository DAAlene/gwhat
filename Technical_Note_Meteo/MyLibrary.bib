	abstract = {Abstract A method to estimate missing daily maximum and minimum temperatures is presented. Temperature estimates are based on departures from daily temperature normals at the three closest stations with similar observation times. Although applied to Cooperative Observer Network stations in the northeastern United States, the approach can be used with any network of stations possessing an adequate station density and period of record. Generally, 75\% of the estimates for both daily maximum and minimum temperature are within 1.7°C of the observed value. Median absolute differences between estimated and observed minimum temperatures, however, tend to be greater than those associated with maximum temperatures. For minimum temperatures, median absolute differences are approximately 1.0°C, whereas for maximum temperatures these differences are near 0.5°C. The accuracy of the estimates is independent of observation time, geographic location, and observed temperature but is influenced somewhat by station density.},

	abstract = {Abstract One of the major concerns with detecting global climate change is the quality of the data. Climate data are extremely sensitive to errant values and outliers. Prior to analysis of these time series, it is important to remove outliers in a methodical manner. This study provides statistically derived bounds for the uncertainty associated with surface temperature and precipitation measurements and yields a baseline dataset for validation of climate models as well as for a variety of other climatological uses. A two-step procedure using objective analysis was used to identify outliers. The first step was a temporal check that determines if a particular monthly value is consistent with other monthly values for the same station. The second step utilizes six different spatial interpolation techniques to estimate each monthly time series. Each of the methods is ranked according to its respective correlation coefficients with the actual time series, and the technique with the highest correlation coefficient is chosen as the best estimator. For both temperature and precipitation, a multiple regression scheme was found to be the best estimator for the majority of records. Results from the two steps are merged, and a combined set of quality control flags are generated.},

	abstract = {Reliable estimation of missing data is an important task for meteorologists, hydrologists and environment protection workers all over the world. In recent years, artificial intelligence techniques have gained enormous interest of many researchers in estimating of missing values. In the current study, we evaluated 11 artificial intelligence and classical techniques to determine the most suitable model for estimating of climatological data in three different climate conditions of Iran. In this case, 5 years (2001–2005) of observed data at target and neighborhood stations were used to estimate missing data of monthly minimum temperature, maximum temperature, mean air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and precipitation variables. The comparison includes both visual and parametric approaches using such statistic as mean absolute errors, coefficient of efficiency and skill score. In general, it was found that although the artificial intelligence techniques are more complex and time-consuming models in identifying their best structures for optimum estimation, but they outperform the classical methods in estimating missing data in three distinct climate conditions. Moreover, the in-filling done by artificial neural network rivals that by genetic programming and sometimes becomes more satisfactory, especially for precipitation data. The results also indicated that multiple regression analysis method is the suitable method among the classical methods. The results of this research proved the high importance of choosing the best and most precise method in estimating different climatological data in Iran and other arid and semi-arid regions.},

	abstract = {A regression-based approach for temperature data reconstruction has been used to fill the gaps in the series of automatic temperature records obtained from the meteorological network of Veneto Region (northeastern Italy). The method presented is characterized by a dynamic selection of the reconstructing stations and of the coupling period that can precede or follow the missing data. Each gap is considered as a specific case, identifying the best set of stations and the period that minimizes the estimated reconstruction error for the gap, thus permitting a potentially better adaptation to time-dependent factors affecting the relationships between stations. The best sampling size is determined through an inference procedure, permitting a highly specific selection of the parameters used to fill each gap in the time series. With a proper selection of the parameters, the average errors of reconstruction are close to 0 and those corresponding to the 95th percentile are typically around 0.1°C. In comparison with similar regression-based approaches, the errors are lower, particularly for minimum temperatures, and the method limits inversions between the minimum, mean, and maximum temperatures.},
