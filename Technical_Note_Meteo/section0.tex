This paper presents a free and open-source algorithm, written in the Python programming language, that was developed to fill the gaps in daily weather datasets with an automated, robust, and efficient method. The missing data for a given weather station are estimated using a multiple linear regression model, generated using synchronous data from neighboring stations. The algorithm was tested for a network of 19 weather stations located in the Monteregie Est region, Quebec, Canada. The uncertainty of the estimates were assessed with a cross-validation procedure, which is included as part of the algorithm. The method gave consistent results for the daily mean, max, and min air temperature and daily total precipitation for all of the weather stations tested. Uncertainty of the results compared well with other studies that also used a similar approach. In addition, the algorithm can also be used with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that is part of the free and Open Source software WHAT (Well Hydrograph Analysis Toolbox).
