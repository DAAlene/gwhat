The aim of WHAT is to ease the interpretation and valorization of groundwater level time series measured in observation wells. 

Presently, are available in WHAT v4.0.5:

- Automatic downloading and formatting of weather data available on the Governement of Canada website (http://climate.weather.gc.ca/). Weather data from any other sources can still be used, but the data must be formated to a prescribed format in order to be compatible with the program.
- Automatic completion of daily climatological series. Missing daily meteorological data for a given weather station are estimated using a multiple linear regression model, generated using data from neighboring stations.
- Automatic plotting of the well hydrograph along with meteorological data on a same graph.
- Automatic generation of monthly and yearly averages for a given daily weather data record.

Future developments include:

- Estimation of groundwater recharge.
- Barometric Response Function (BRF) analysis.
- Master Recession Curve (MRC) estimation
