# About GWHAT

GWHAT (Ground-Water Hydrograph Analysis Toolbox) is a free, open source, and cross-platform interactive computer program whose main focus is the interpretation of observation well hydrographs, including:
* the generation of various publication-quality figures from the weather and water level data;

* the exploration, manipulation, and validation of the data within a user-friendly dynamic graphical environment;

* the calculation of the master recession curve (MRC) of the well hydrograph (experimental);

* the estimation of groundwater recharge at the local scale in unconfined conditions with a method combining the daily meteorological data and the water level time series (will be available in a future release).

* the calculation of the barometric response function of the well that can be used to assess the level of confinement of the aquifer at the well location (will be available in a future release).

GWHAT is written in the Python 3 programming language and is currently maintained and developed by [Jean-Sébastien Gosselin](http://www.liamg.ca/en/about-us/jean-sebastien-gosselin/) at [INRS-ETE](http://ete.inrs.ca/).

If you encounter any problems or errors during program execution, have any questions, or have specific suggestions on how to improve GWHAT, please contact Jean-Sébastien Gosselin at [jean-sebastien.gosselin@ete.inrs.ca](mailto:jean-sebastien.gosselin@ete.inrs.ca) or open an issue in our issues tracker [here](https://github.com/jnsebgosselin/gwhat/issues).
