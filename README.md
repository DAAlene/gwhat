# About GWHAT

GWHAT (Ground-Water Hydrograph Analysis Toolbox) is a free and open source interactive computer program whose main focus is the interpretation of observation well hydrographs in order to evaluate groundwater recharge with a method combining a daily soil moisture balance and an aquifer
water budget applicable to unconfined aquifers. The method is described in detail in the PhD thesis of Jean-Sébastien Gosselin which is available [here](http://espace.inrs.ca/id/eprint/5122/).

GWHAT is written in the Python 3 programming language and is currently maintained and developed by Jean-Sébastien Gosselin at [INRS-ETE](http://ete.inrs.ca/). If you encounter any problems or errors during program execution, have any questions, or have specific suggestions on how to improve GWHAT, please open an issue in our  [issues tracker](https://github.com/jnsebgosselin/gwhat/issues).
