What is WHAT
============
WHAT is a free, open source, and cross-platform interactive computer program which ultimate aim is to ease the interpretation and valorization of groundwater level time series measured in observation wells. It is developped at [INRS-ETE](http://ete.inrs.ca/) by [Jean-Sébastien Gosselin](http://www.liamg.ca/en/about-us/jean-sebastien-gosselin/) under the direction and co-direction of [Richard Martel](http://www.inrs.ca/richard-martel) and [Christine Rivard](http://science.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&n=E3024D2D-1&xsl=sdmtprofile&xml=E3024D2D-1AB4-4F74-AF13-755D0DCF3E13&formid=B03536B8-8F8E-4BC1-A5BF-D62B13F57A8B&showfromadmin=1&readonly=true).

A user guide is currently being prepared and should be available shortly. WHAT is currently under heavy development and is unfortunately not yet complete or free of bugs. If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jean-Sébastien Gosselin at jnsebgosselin@gmail.com. To download a Windows package version of the software click on the button "release" on top of this page or follow this [Link](https://github.com/jnsebgosselin/WHAT/releases). 

Presently are available in WHAT v4.0.5:
----------------------------------------

- Automatic downloading and formatting of weather data available on the Governement of Canada website (http://climate.weather.gc.ca/). Weather data from any other sources can still be used, but the data must be formated to a prescribed format in order to be compatible with the program.
- Automatic completion of daily climatological series. Missing daily meteorological data for a given weather station are estimated using a multiple linear regression model, generated using data from neighboring stations.
- Automatic plotting of the well hydrograph along with meteorological data on a same graph.
- Automatic plotting of monthly and yearly averages for a given daily weather data record.

Future developments include:
----------------------------

- Groundwater recharge estimation.
- Barometric Response Function (BRF) analysis.
- Master Recession Curve (MRC) estimation.
